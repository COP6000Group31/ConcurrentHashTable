# Concurrent Hash Table

## Building

Run `make` to build `chash`.

## Linting and Formatting

Ensure clang-tidy and clang-format are installed.

Run `make check` to run lint and format checks.

Run `make fix` to repair any lint and format errors.

Alternatively, install [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation.html) for your editor.
In VSCode, clangd will allow for calling `Shift+Alt+F` to format files in LLVM style.
It will also provide tooltips for struct layouts and doc comments.

## Contributing

Use LLVM style code and Doxygen doc comments.
